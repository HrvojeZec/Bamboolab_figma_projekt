            distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme
            executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from

              Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? The Lady of the Lake, her arm
              clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the
              bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I,
              Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am your king. Come
              and see the violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! I'm being
              repressed! I'm Brian, and so's my wife! I don't want to talk to
              you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in
              your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father
